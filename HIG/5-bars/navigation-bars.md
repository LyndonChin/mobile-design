## Navigation Bar Titles

Standard title / Large title

Use a large title when you need to provide extra emphasis on context. 

## Navigation Bar Controls

* Avoid crowding a navigation bar with too many controls.
* Use the standard back button.
* Don’t include multisegment breadcrumb paths.
* Give text-titled buttons enough room.
* Consider using a segmented control in a navigation bar to flatten your app's information hierarchy.
