Action Sheets
---

An action sheet is a specific style of **alert** that appears in response to a **control** or **action**, and presents a set of two or more **choices** related to the current **context**.

* Provide a Cancel button if it adds clarity.
* Make destructive choices prominent.
* Avoid enabling scrolling in an action sheet.
    * Scrolling requires extra time to make a choice and is hard to do without inadvertently tapping a button.
