The launch screen is quickly replaced with the first screen of your app, giving the impression that your app is fast and responsive.

Every app must supply a launch screen.

* Design a launch screen that’s nearly identical to the first screen of your app.
* Avoid including text on your launch screen.
* Downplay launch.
* Don’t advertise.
