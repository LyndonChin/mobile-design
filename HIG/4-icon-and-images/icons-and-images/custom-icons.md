Custom Icons
---

* Create recognizable, highly-simplified designs.
* Design icons as glyphs.
* Prepare glyphs with a scale factor of @2x and save them as PDFs.
    * PDF is a vector format that allows for high-resolution scaling, it's typically sufficient to provide a single @2x version in your app and allow it to scale for other resolutions.
* Keep your icons consistent.
* Make sure icons are legible.
* Use color to communicate selected and deselected states.
* Avoid including text in an icon.
* Donâ€™t use replicas of Apple hardware products.
* Provide alternative text labels for icons.
