Image Size and Resolution
---

* Supply high-resolution images for all artwork in your app, for all devices your app supports.


Designing High-Resolution Artwork
---

* Use an 8px-by-8px grid.
* Produce artwork in the appropriate format.
    * PNG supports transparency and, because it's lossless, compression artifacts don't blur important details or alter colors.
    *  Use PDF for glyphs and other flat, vector artwork that requires high-resolution scaling.
* Use the 8-bit color palette for PNG graphics that donâ€™t require full 24-bit color.
* Optimize JPEG files to find a balance between size and quality.
* Provide alternative text labels for images and icons.
